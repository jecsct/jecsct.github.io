                            After ISCTE, I decided to enroll at Técnico to embrace new challenges and maybe come across
                            new
                            opportunities and people.
                            Some of that did happen... :)
                            <br>
                            I had the opportunity to meet a lot of new people, but not only that — I worked with people
                            I
                            didn’t know and had never worked with before. In each project group, I collaborated with
                            different people from diverse backgrounds.
                            With all those interactions, I had to really push myself to develop some perhaps
                            underdeveloped
                            teamwork, communication, and interpersonal skills, which had been somewhat suppressed at
                            ISCTE
                            due to always working with the same two friends.
                            <br>
                            Técnico also challenged the way I worked — more specifically, the pace. At Técnico, every
                            subject was taught in half the time compared to ISCTE, but in return, instead of learning
                            and
                            working on 4–5 subjects at a time, we only focused on 2–3.
                            To me, this was a big change. At the beginning, I didn’t adapt well and had to rely more on
                            others to cover my newfound weaknesses.
                            But I kept pushing, never gave up, and by the end of the first round of subjects, I had
                            already
                            conquered the new learning pace and was ready for the next rounds.
                            <br>
                            When I reached the halfway point of my master’s thesis, my professor offered me a thesis
                            grant
                            to continue developing it and as a financial incentive.
                            By the end of my master’s, I graduated with the following grades:

                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Thesis final grade</strong>: 18 out of 20</li>
                                <li><strong>Course final grade</strong>: 16 out of 20</li>
                            </ul>

                            <p>Here at ISCTE, my Software Engineering journey began. It was where I learned everything
                                from
                                the basics to more advanced programming concepts — starting with simple Java programs
                                like
                                adding integer variables, to building fully functional websites with front-end,
                                back-end,
                                and databases, and solving complex processing problems involving multi-threading,
                                parallelism, and understanding which algorithms and data structures to use and why.</p>

                            <p>It was here at ISCTE that I developed my passion for programming and, essentially,
                                solving
                                puzzles. This is where all my software engineering foundations were laid.</p>

                            <p>Not only that, but I also made two great friends here who accompanied me throughout my
                                entire
                                journey at ISCTE. We always teamed up, learned from each other’s mistakes, and pushed
                                through tough times when nothing we tried seemed to work.</p>

                            <p>ISCTE was a place I would return to without a second thought if asked. Everything and
                                everyone felt right. With all this appreciation for ISCTE, at the end of my Bachelor's,
                                I
                                was awarded the 'ISTA Top Talent' prize — given only to students who achieved a final
                                grade
                                of 16 or above that academic year. I was also invited by the course director to be a
                                student
                                ambassador, where I represented my course to prospective students and answered any
                                questions
                                they had about the course and ISCTE.</p>

                            <p>By the end of my journey here, I had gained new friends, new connections, and a whole new
                                set
                                of skills that I intended to use to build my career. I finished ISCTE with the following
                                grade:</p>

                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Final Grade</strong>: 16 out of 20</li>

                            <p>During my master’s thesis, I had the opportunity to receive funding to continue
                                developing my
                                research — an offer I gladly accepted. This financial support allowed me to fully
                                focus on
                                pushing the project further and delivering a high-quality solution.</p>

                            <p>My thesis, <strong>"InsureConnect: Blockchain and Digital Identity in the Insurance
                                    Market"</strong>, explored how blockchain and self-sovereign identity (SSI)
                                technologies
                                can transform the insurance sector — particularly in streamlining the process of
                                contract
                                management and property damage claims.</p>

                            <p>The main goal of the project was to design and develop a decentralized registry
                                platform
                                where insurance companies and clients could interact securely, transparently, and
                                efficiently — without relying on traditional login systems. Instead, digital
                                identities
                                compliant with SSI principles were used for authentication and signing actions.</p>

                            <p>Key features of the platform included:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Smart contract-based workflows</strong> to register and manage insurance
                                    agreements and claims.</li>
                                <li><strong>SSI-based identity verification</strong> to ensure data privacy and
                                    ownership by
                                    clients and insurers.</li>
                                <li><strong>Blockchain integration (Hyperledger Fabric)</strong> for immutability
                                    and
                                    traceability of all actions.</li>
                                <li><strong>Decentralized file storage using IPFS</strong> for handling large files
                                    like
                                    images or documents related to claims, while storing the content address (hash)
                                    on the
                                    blockchain.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <p>The outcome was a working prototype that demonstrated how blockchain and SSI can
                                enhance
                                trust, security, and efficiency in real-world insurance interactions — reducing
                                fraud and
                                minimizing administrative overhead.</p>

                                <p>Currently, I'm developing a project where I try to apply all these technologies. Even
                                    after five years of coding in Java, I had never used the Spring framework, so I
                                    thought it was time to learn it. While at it, I figured I might as well explore
                                    message queue systems with Apache Kafka and API testing with Postman.</p>

                                    The project I'm working on is an order placement and delivery tracking system, where
                                    a user places an order, pays for it, and gets notified about its location. All of
                                    the microservices communicate with each other through Kafka message queues.

                                <p>This was a knowledge-filled year and also the year I transitioned from ISCTE to
                                    Técnico.
                                    Each new subject and project introduced me to new technologies.</p>

                                <p>I started the year by diving deeper into C++ with an Arduino project. The goal was to
                                    program two traffic lights, each with a button to shorten its cycle timer. What made
                                    this project tricky was that, after developing our semaphores, our group had to
                                    integrate a third and fourth Arduinos programmed by another group and everything had
                                    to
                                    work with
                                    minimal tuning. The traffic lights were controlled by a central entity that sent
                                    signals
                                    to change the lights. Our code had to be as modular as possible to allow easy
                                    addition
                                    and removal of components.</p>

                                <p>Next came an Android project. The goal was to build an app for managing free
                                    libraries
                                    spread across the city. Users could add and remove books from different libraries by
                                    scanning their QR codes. All data was stored in a centralized SQLite3 database. The
                                    app
                                    was developed in Python with flask.</p>

                                <p>After that, we tackled a project focused on performance-aware auto-scaling using AWS
                                    infrastructure. We launched several EC2 instances behind a load balancer and
                                    configured
                                    an auto-scaler. These instances executed compute-intensive tasks, and the objective
                                    was
                                    to automatically scale the number of running instances to handle all incoming
                                    requests.
                                    Additionally, DynamoDB was used to store performance metrics for each request.</p>

                                <p>To wrap up the year, we developed a full-featured website using a microservices
                                    architecture hosted on Google Cloud Platform (GCP). The project infrastructure was
                                    defined using Terraform and deployed accordingly. Once the virtual machines were up
                                    and
                                    running, Ansible playbooks were used to configure the instances and install all
                                    necessary software and commands automatically. The microservices shared a SQLite3
                                    database. Furthermore, Prometheus and Grafana were
                                    integrated with the microservices to monitor and track various performance metrics.

                                <p>Finally, after so much, the end of the bachelor’s degree was getting closer. With it
                                    came
                                    the last steps, just a few edges left to polish. To wrap up our tech journey, this
                                    final semester focused heavily on combining technologies and concepts we’d learned
                                    throughout the previous semesters.</p>

                                <p>But some fine-tuning was still needed. So, we learned about software architecture
                                    principles and how crucial they are to developing professional, maintainable code.
                                    We
                                    also covered unit testing, finally moving past the 1001 print statements,
                                    and added a new type of database to our repertoire: NoSQL, specifically MongoDB.</p>

                                <p>After grasping OOP, I dived into parallel and functional programming (jesus christ
                                    never
                                    again). Parallel programming was surprisingly intuitive. Once I understood
                                    how locks worked for shared resources and how to avoid race conditions, most of it
                                    felt
                                    straightforward.</p>

                                <p>Functional programming, on the other hand, was a nightmare. Not being allowed to use
                                    loops was incredibly frustrating. We really struggled to finish the project, but
                                    somehow, we pulled through.</p>

                                <p>This was also the year I learned how to program in Python and used my first
                                    full-stack
                                    framework: Django. As a group, we developed a complete website to sell various
                                    items. It
                                    was also the first time I touched HTML and CSS. The site included product pages, a
                                    login
                                    and authentication system, profile pages, and user reviews — all with data stored in
                                    a
                                    SQLite3 database.</p>

                                <p>During the development of this project, my friends and I, freshly introduced to Agile
                                    methodologies, decided to use Trello to manage our workflow. It turned out to be
                                    incredibly useful. Instead of randomly assigning tasks and forgetting what needed to
                                    be
                                    done, we kept everything documented and neatly organized.</p>

                                <p>After grasping the basics of programming, I moved on to learning about
                                    object-oriented
                                    programming, which really helped me write more structured code. Instead of putting
                                    everything in the same file — or even in the same function — I began organizing my
                                    code,
                                    and it finally started to look at least "somewhat professional"... though still far
                                    from
                                    it hahaha. My first fully-fledged app was a Sokoban game.</p>

                                <p>Around this time, I also learned about SQL and databases. I didn’t really get it at
                                    first,
                                    SQL seemed super confusing in the beginning, but eventually it clicked, as
                                    everything
                                    eventually does.</p>

                                <p>I also started dabbling in C and shell scripting. While shell scripts were relatively
                                    easy to understand (regex expressions tho💀), C was super confusing for me at first.
                                    Coming from Java, which handles pointers, garbage collection, and gives you clear
                                    error
                                    messages, C felt like being thrown into the deep end with the segmation faults (core
                                    dumped).</p>
