                        After ISCTE, I decided to enroll at Técnico to embrace new challenges and maybe come across new
                        opportunities and people.
                        Some of that did happen... :)
                        <br>
                        I had the opportunity to meet a lot of new people, but not only that — I worked with people I
                        didn’t know and had never worked with before. In each project group, I collaborated with
                        different people from diverse backgrounds.
                        With all those interactions, I had to really push myself to develop some perhaps underdeveloped
                        teamwork, communication, and interpersonal skills, which had been somewhat suppressed at ISCTE
                        due to always working with the same two friends.
                        <br>
                        Técnico also challenged the way I worked — more specifically, the pace. At Técnico, every
                        subject was taught in half the time compared to ISCTE, but in return, instead of learning and
                        working on 4–5 subjects at a time, we only focused on 2–3.
                        To me, this was a big change. At the beginning, I didn’t adapt well and had to rely more on
                        others to cover my newfound weaknesses.
                        But I kept pushing, never gave up, and by the end of the first round of subjects, I had already
                        conquered the new learning pace and was ready for the next rounds.
                        <br>
                        When I reached the halfway point of my master’s thesis, my professor offered me a thesis grant
                        to continue developing it and as a financial incentive.
                        By the end of my master’s, I graduated with the following grades:

                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Thesis final grade</strong>: 18 out of 20</li>
                            <li><strong>Course final grade</strong>: 16 out of 20</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>Here at ISCTE, my Software Engineering journey began. It was where I learned everything from
                            the basics to more advanced programming concepts — starting with simple Java programs like
                            adding integer variables, to building fully functional websites with front-end, back-end,
                            and databases, and solving complex processing problems involving multi-threading,
                            parallelism, and understanding which algorithms and data structures to use and why.</p>

                        <p>It was here at ISCTE that I developed my passion for programming and, essentially, solving
                            puzzles. This is where all my software engineering foundations were laid.</p>

                        <p>Not only that, but I also made two great friends here who accompanied me throughout my entire
                            journey at ISCTE. We always teamed up, learned from each other’s mistakes, and pushed
                            through tough times when nothing we tried seemed to work.</p>

                        <p>ISCTE was a place I would return to without a second thought if asked. Everything and
                            everyone felt right. With all this appreciation for ISCTE, at the end of my Bachelor's, I
                            was awarded the 'ISTA Top Talent' prize — given only to students who achieved a final grade
                            of 16 or above that academic year. I was also invited by the course director to be a student
                            ambassador, where I represented my course to prospective students and answered any questions
                            they had about the course and ISCTE.</p>

                        <p>By the end of my journey here, I had gained new friends, new connections, and a whole new set
                            of skills that I intended to use to build my career. I finished ISCTE with the following
                            grade:</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Final Grade</strong>: 16 out of 20</li>

                    <div class="box-content">
                        <p>During my master’s thesis, I had the opportunity to receive funding to continue developing my
                            research — an offer I gladly accepted. This financial support allowed me to fully focus on
                            pushing the project further and delivering a high-quality solution.</p>

                        <p>My thesis, <strong>"InsureConnect: Blockchain and Digital Identity in the Insurance
                                Market"</strong>, explored how blockchain and self-sovereign identity (SSI) technologies
                            can transform the insurance sector — particularly in streamlining the process of contract
                            management and property damage claims.</p>

                        <p>The main goal of the project was to design and develop a decentralized registry platform
                            where insurance companies and clients could interact securely, transparently, and
                            efficiently — without relying on traditional login systems. Instead, digital identities
                            compliant with SSI principles were used for authentication and signing actions.</p>

                        <p>Key features of the platform included:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Smart contract-based workflows</strong> to register and manage insurance
                                agreements and claims.</li>
                            <li><strong>SSI-based identity verification</strong> to ensure data privacy and ownership by
                                clients and insurers.</li>
                            <li><strong>Blockchain integration (Hyperledger Fabric)</strong> for immutability and
                                traceability of all actions.</li>
                            <li><strong>Decentralized file storage using IPFS</strong> for handling large files like
                                images or documents related to claims, while storing the content address (hash) on the
                                blockchain.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>The outcome was a working prototype that demonstrated how blockchain and SSI can enhance
                            trust, security, and efficiency in real-world insurance interactions — reducing fraud and
                            minimizing administrative overhead.</p>
